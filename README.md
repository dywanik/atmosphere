# atmosphere
Exponential Atmospheric Model as described by Vallado in his Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications (2nd Edition). This will help you plot changes in atmospheric pressure and density.

You need to launch the atmosphere.py and you will be asked if you want to calculate the density and pressure on particular altitude or on an altitude span. I you choose 2nd option then you'll get nice plot of the changes.

### Prerequisites
- python3
- matplotlib
```
pip install matplotlib
```
### Usage
Simply enter
```
$ python atmosphere.py
```
and answer the questions. Next, expect a new window with a plot to popup.
